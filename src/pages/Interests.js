                   I love playing dungeons and dragons, specifically Pathfinder,
                   which is an offshoot of D&D 3.5. I am the dungeron master for
                   a few groups and created a number of campaigns and worlds
                   from scratch. I hope to one day "publish" these as playable
                   modules for others. For now, I'm creating a few github
                   repos. More to come!

                 When I was attending the university of Michigan for graduate
                 school, I took a few courses to learn how to play the carillon,
                 which is the instrument housed in a bell tower. I played both
                 the piano and organ when I was growing up and so learning the
                 carillon was a great stress release when in graduate school.
                 The University of Michigan has two lovely carillon - The
                 Charles Baird Carillon housed in Burton Memorial Tower and
                 The Robert and Ann Lurie Carillon housed on North Campus. I
                 always enjoyed perfuming the Ann Arbor air with music. Click

                 I really enjoy watching the NBA. It is one of my ways to
                 survive the Minnesotan winters. I love following the
                 Washington Wizards and hope, one day in my lifetime, they
                 manage to put together a magical season. Since living in
                 Minnesota, I've developed a soft spot for the Timberwolves.
                 Between the wolves and wizards, there hasn't been too mcuh to
                 cheer for recently.
