I used this as a side project to learn a little more about front-end design. I'm choosing
to deploy a REACT app via github pages. I'll use the README here to document my process
and debugging.

### Getting started

First, I install node
```
sudo apt-get install nodejs
sudo apt-get install npm
```
Then I installed
```
sudo npm install -g create-react-app
```

### Deploying
